# P.E.D Aerial Inspection – Landing Page

## Description
This project is a single-page web application created for SBA 316 to demonstrate practical use of the Document Object Model (DOM) and Browser Object Model (BOM). The application represents a landing page for P.E.D Aerial Inspection, a drone-based inspection service.

Users can view available services and submit an inspection request through an interactive form.

## Features
- Dynamic DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- Event-driven user interactions (click and submit events)
- Form validation using both HTML attributes and JavaScript
- Dynamic content creation using createElement and appendChild
- Browser Object Model usage (alert and localStorage)
- Clean, scalable project structure suitable for future expansion

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (DOM & BOM)
- Git & GitHub

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Interact with the page to submit an inspection request
